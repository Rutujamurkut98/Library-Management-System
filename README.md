# Library-Management-System
A simple Java-based CLI Library Management System built using OOP principles. This project allows users to add, view, issue, and return books. It also supports user registration and maintains records using ArrayList. Developed as part of the Elevate Labs Java Internship tasks.

# 🗂️ Task 3 - Library Management System

## 📌 Task Objective
Develop a mini **Library Management System** using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java.


## 🛠 Features Implemented
- 📚 Add new books to the library  
- 👤 Register new users  
- 📖 Issue a book to a user  
- 🔁 Return a book  
- ❌ Prevent issuing already issued books  
- 🔎 View available and issued books  


## 💡 OOP Concepts Used
- ✅ **Abstraction** – Core entities like Book, User, and Library are represented as classes  
- ✅ **Encapsulation** – Class members are accessed using getters/setters  
- ✅ **Inheritance** – (If implemented) e.g., base class for common attributes  
- ✅ **Polymorphism** – Method overriding (optional for enhancements)


## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java  
- **Tool**: VS Code or any Java IDE  
- **Execution**: Terminal (CLI)  
- **Storage**: In-memory using `ArrayList`
